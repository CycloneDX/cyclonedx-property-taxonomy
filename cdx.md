## `cdx` Namespace Taxonomy

| Namespace | Description | Administered By | Taxonomy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cdx:gomod` | Namespace for properties specific to the Go Module ecosystem. | CycloneDX Go Maintainers | [cdx:gomod taxonomy](cdx/gomod.md) |

## Registering `cdx` Namespaces and Properties

The process for registering new `cdx` namespaces and properties is to
[create a new issue requesting it](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-property-taxonomy/issues/new/choose).

If you are requesting a new namespace directly under the `cdx` namespace,
the request will be reviewed by the Core Working Group.

If you are requesting a new namespace or property under one of the
namespaces within `cdx`, it will be reviewed by the team identified in the
table above.
